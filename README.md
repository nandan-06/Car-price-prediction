# Car price prediction

### Created the complete model using pandas and NumPy.

### Dataset used is from kaggle.

- Performed Exploratory data analysis.
- Divided the datasets into training, validation and test datasets.
- Selected various features that could affect the target variable for creating the feature matrix.
- Written the function to prepare the feature matrix.
- Used the categorical features to improve the model
- Written the function for linear regression model using NumPy.
- Performed Regularization on the model.
- Calculated the RMSE values to judge the model.
- Plotted various graphs to visualize data using matplotlib and seaborn.
- Atlast trained the model again on training and validation datasets, this improved the accuracy of the model.
- Refer to the python notebook `carprice.ipynb` for on point explanation.
